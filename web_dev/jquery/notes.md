PLAN FOR LEARNING JQUERY: 2 HOURS

1. Find jQuery docs & bookmark

2. Find platform for sandboxing in jQuery, or some other way to build and test things in jQuery- similar to REPL for Ruby

3. Google for jQuery cheat sheets, tutorials, or other introductory content

4. Read cheat sheets, skim docs, noting major concepts, skills, or things worth practicing

-------- 10 MINUTE BREAK-------------------

5. Use test/practice platform to code along with tutorials, implement concepts from cheat sheets and docs

6. Find and read some professional articles or blog posts about jQuery re: uses, best practices, other professional tidbits

--------------- 10 MINUTE BREAK -----------------

7. Find professional examples of jQuery projects practice identifying major ideas, breaking them down into small steps, pseudocoding along, and understanding what each piece is doing

7a. While doing step 7, stop to reference docs or research code snippets or concepts that are unfamiliar

-------------- POST-RESEARCH NOTES:------------------
I ended having the best luck reading W3school's jQuery tutorials and following along in my own HTML and jQuery files, testing out each new concept on my own. Referencing the jQuery docs at the beginning of my research wasn't super helpful, as the information they provide was beyond the scope of my jQuery schema at that time and I had no frame of reference.

Ultimately, sandboxing proved to be my best friend when learning jQuery, and I had a hunch before I started my research that this would be my best learning tool. I have to be able to code along with instructional materials, tinkering with each piece to really learn it well. I found the W3schools interactive tutorials more than sufficient, and I easily used up the whole 2 hours learning jQuery syntax, selectors, events, and effects. I was just getting comfortable using the jQuery animate method when my timer ran up, and I was really enjoying my practice!

--------- IDEAS FOR RELEASE 2 JQUERY PROJECT:--------------------------------
- Flash card-style study guide that poses a question, and reveals answers when clicked on

- Virtual petting zoo with animal images that can be "pet" by clicking on them; some animals are skittish and run (disapper) when they're just hovered over, others are slightly shy and become opaque/less visible without disappearing, others are friendly and "come closer" (get bigger) when clicked, and some are mad with pet-lust and have crazy huge animations when clicked
