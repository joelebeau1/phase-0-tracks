# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
    Version control allows developers to manage different versions of a project separately from the original or master file, and allows developers to work on individual features separately from the master code base, merge different versions of a project, and roll back a project to an earlier version if needed.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?
    A branch is a new working version of a project, and can be useful to work on new features of a project separate from the master copy.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
    A commit is a save point for a project at a given point in time, and good commit messages succinctly inform readers about what changes, features, or additions are made in each commit.

* What is a merge conflict?
    A merge conflict occurs when Git cannot automatically merge two branches due to discrepancies in the files, such as if the same line of code is changed in two different ways in the branched files and cannot be auto merged.
